## Scenario

Implement a view that displays both user and project data from `src/mock_data/*`, and allows for adding and removing users and projects.

This exercise is meant to see what considerations you take into account when implementing a view, it is not necessarily expected that the view will be feature-complete.

Please refrain from importing additional external libraries unless you believe they are absolutely necessary.

### Required

- Build a React View that displays data for each user grouped by project.

### Recommended

- Allow for removal of entries (users and/or projects)
- Create a form that allows the user to input more entries (users and/or projects)

### Evaluated on

- An accessible, responsive, user-friendly UI/UX
- Creativity
- Modularity
- Clean Code

#### Extra Credit but not required

- Create tests for the application

#### Tools Used in Assessing this Evaluation

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
